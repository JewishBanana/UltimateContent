#
# ITEMS:
#
#   "name" : [STRING] - The visible name displayed for the custom item in game. This supports color codes (e.g. '&c' or '&5') and also hex codes formatted as '(hex:#ffffff)'
#                       if using spigot or a fork of spigot (e.g. paper, purpur, etc.). If you are on vanilla or bukkit then hex codes will auto convert to the closest
#                       vanilla chat color.
#
#   "lore" : [STRING_LIST] - The visible lore of the item displayed in game, this also supports chat colors and hex codes. The formatting can be seen on the example items
#                            below, it is in list format where you can have as many lines as you want. For example:
#
#                                               lore:
#                                               - "&eThis is the first line of lore in YELLOW!"
#                                               - "(hex:#bf0d00)This is the second line in DEEP RED!"
#
#   "damage" : [DECIMAL] - This controls the damage value that the item deals when hitting an entity with a melee attack, pretty self explanatory.
#
#   "attackSpeed" : [DECIMAL] - This controls the attack speed attribute of the item (The attack cooldown bar).
#
#   "projectileDamage" : [DECIMAL] - This controls the items damage it deals if it hits an entity as a projectile, this setting only works on items that can actually be fired
#                                    as projectiles e.g. snowballs, arrows, tridents, etc.
#
#   "projectileDamageMultiplier" : [DOUBLE] - This setting multiplies the damage dealt by projectiles fired from this item, this setting has a default value set to 1.0 and
#                                             only has an effect on items that can actually shoot projectiles e.g. bows, crossbows, etc.
#
#   "durability" : [DECIMAL] - This controls the items durability, if set it will override the vanilla durability of the item. If you want to ignore item durability and make
#                              an item unbreakable set the value to -1.
#
#   "abilities" : [SECTION] - This is the list of abilities on the item, abilities can be put or removed on any item with no limits and full control. This also supports 
#                             abilities that are external from UltimateContent. The different ability settings are listed in the section below this. To add abilities you need
#                             to put them in the following format:
#
#                                               abilities:
#                                                   [ability_name]:
#                                                       [setting_1]: [value]
#                                                       [setting_2]: [value]
#                                                       [setting_3]: [value]
#
#   "allow_vanilla_crafts" : [BOOLEAN] - By default this is FALSE for every item. This setting enables if the custom item can be used in vanilla crafting recipes e.g. The
#                                        custom item is an iron ingot and if it should be able to craft an block of iron or not.
#
#   "allow_vanilla_enchanting" : [BOOLEAN] - By default this is TRUE for every item. This setting enables if the custom item can be enchanted with vanilla enchants e.g. Anvil
#                                            enchant book recipes, enchanting tables.
#
#   "enchants" : [SECTION] - This setting is a config section that lists the enchants on this item and their levels. This can also support enchants external of
#                            UltimateContent and also vanilla minecraft enchants (Vanilla enchant levels can be set higher than their level cap). Example usage provided below:
#
#                                               enchants:
#                                                   sharpness: 9
#                                                   bunny_hop: 2

###############################################################################################################################################################################
#
# ABILITY SETTINGS:
#
# Within each item you can add a section "abilities" which is listed above this section for more information, and you can add as many abilities you want to the item within
# this section. The following settings listed here are global settings that all abilities can use, keep in mind that there are two sub-sections to this section, one which has
# global settings for all abilities even external of UltimateContent, and the other sub-section has global settings that are unique specifically to UltimateContent abilities.
# If an external plugin which adds more abilities is a fork of UltimateContent, these settings may be applicable to those abilities to, if not will just have no affect.
#
# UNIVERSAL SETTINGS:
#
#   "cooldown" : [DECIMAL] - This is the cooldown in seconds for the ability given to the user upon successful usage.
#
#   "usage" : [STRING_LIST] - The bound actions for usage of this ability, this is almost always required with a few abilities being an exception. Here is a list of all usages:
#
#                             "left-click", "left-click-block", "shift-left-click", "shift-left-click-block", "right-click", "right-click-block", "shift-right-click",
#                             "shift-right-click-block", "inventory-click", "consume", "splash-potion", "interact-entity", "drop-item", "pickup-item", "place-block",

#                                 displays section of this config and can be referenced here in this setting. An example is how I create a fake display called "bunny_hop" and
#                                 reference it in the double jump ability for the bunny hop enchant, this relabels the abilities display name and description on the item's
#                                 lore to my display "bunny_hop"'s name and description.
#
# ULTIMATECONTENT UNIQUE SETTINGS:

#                          and by default this is set to 100.0 for all abilities to guarantee activation.
#

#                         the abilities cooldown upon activation this just modifies where the ability activates. This is a list of all the different target types you can use:
#

# DISPLAYS:
#
# Displays are alternate ability displays that can be referenced within ability settings on items. They just simply replace the name and description of the ability in the
# item's lore with the name and description of the display. An example usage of why displays are useful is I create one called "bunny_hop" and reference it in the bunny hop
# enchant on the double jump ability, this means that instead of listing the ability as a double jump it will list it as my custom display bunny hop renaming the ability.
#
# * "name" : [STRING] - The name that will replace the abilities name. Supports chat color and hex codes.
#
# * "description" : [STRING] - The description that will replace the abilities description. Supports chat color and hex codes.
