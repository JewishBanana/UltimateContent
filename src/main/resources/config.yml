general:
    # This section controls the affects of UltimateContent within protected regions. The applicable region protection plugins are listed on the plugins page!
    protected_regions:
        # This setting controls if abilities can activate and take affect on entities within protected regions
        affect_entities: true
        # This setting controls if abilities can damage the environment within protected regions
        damage_blocks: false
    # This section is for modifying settings related to the special limited seasonal events within the plugin

        # Toggles if special events are enabled or not on the server
        enabled: true
        # This controls if players are sent messages indicating if an event is currently on-going or when they make progress on an event

    # This section controls what entities and blocks are blacklisted entirely from being harmed/broken from abilities. Each ability can have its own personal blacklist, 
    # however, this blacklist section is a global list meaning that these entries will automatically be added to every single abilities blacklist making configuration easier.

#
# ITEMS:
#
# This section is designated for all the custom items in UltimateContent. The items are sorted by their category such as weapons, armor, crafting, seasonal, etc. All of the
# information below explains what each config setting does for each item. Most items do not have all of these settings within their configuration but they are all supported
# so you can just manually add a setting that is not present if you desire. Keep in mind that you cannot change the actual command name of the item that is used for the give
# command. Any user input errors in the configuration will be explained in the server console with details such as unexpected values or non existent items so be sure to check.
#
#   "name" : [STRING] - The visible name displayed for the custom item in game. This supports color codes (e.g. '&c' or '&5') and also hex codes formatted as '(hex:#ffffff)'
#                       if using spigot or a fork of spigot (e.g. paper, purpur, etc.). If you are on vanilla or bukkit then hex codes will auto convert to the closest
#                       vanilla chat color.
#
#   "lore" : [STRING_LIST] - The visible lore of the item displayed in game, this also supports chat colors and hex codes. The formatting can be seen on the example items
#                            below, it is in list format where you can have as many lines as you want. For example:
#
#                                               lore:
#                                               - "&eThis is the first line of lore in YELLOW!"
#                                               - "(hex:#bf0d00)This is the second line in DEEP RED!"
#
#   "damage" : [DECIMAL] - This controls the damage value that the item deals when hitting an entity with a melee attack, pretty self explanatory.
#
#   "attackSpeed" : [DECIMAL] - This controls the attack speed attribute of the item (The attack cooldown bar).
#
#   "projectileDamage" : [DECIMAL] - This controls the items damage it deals if it hits an entity as a projectile, this setting only works on items that can actually be fired
#                                    as projectiles e.g. snowballs, arrows, tridents, etc.
#
#   "projectileDamageMultiplier" : [DECIMAL] - This setting multiplies the damage dealt by projectiles fired from this item, this setting has a default value set to 1.0 and
#                                              only has an effect on items that can actually shoot projectiles e.g. bows, crossbows, etc.
#
#   "durability" : [DECIMAL] - This controls the items durability, if set it will override the vanilla durability of the item. If you want to ignore item durability and make
#                              an item unbreakable set the value to -1.
#
#   "abilities" : [SECTION] - This is the list of abilities on the item, abilities can be put or removed on any item with no limits and full control. This also supports 
#                             abilities that are external from UltimateContent. The different ability settings are listed in the section below this. To add abilities you need
#                             to put them in the following format:
#
#                                               abilities:
#                                                   [ability_name]:
#                                                       [setting_1]: [value]
#                                                       [setting_2]: [value]
#                                                       [setting_3]: [value]
#
#   "allow_vanilla_crafts" : [BOOLEAN] - By default this is FALSE for every item. This setting enables if the custom item can be used in vanilla crafting recipes e.g. The
#                                        custom item is an iron ingot and if it should be able to craft an block of iron or not.
#
#   "allow_vanilla_enchanting" : [BOOLEAN] - By default this is TRUE for every item. This setting enables if the custom item can be enchanted with vanilla enchants e.g. Anvil
#                                            enchant book recipes, enchanting tables.
#
#   "enchants" : [SECTION] - This setting is a config section that lists the enchants on this item and their levels. This can also support enchants external of
#                            UltimateContent and also vanilla minecraft enchants (Vanilla enchant levels can be set higher than their level cap). Example usage provided below:
#
#                                               enchants:
#                                                   sharpness: 9
#                                                   bunny_hop: 2

###############################################################################################################################################################################
#
# ABILITY SETTINGS:
#
# Within each item you can add a section "abilities" which is listed above this section for more information, and you can add as many abilities you want to the item within
# this section. The following settings listed here are global settings that all abilities can use, keep in mind that there are two sub-sections to this section, one which has
# global settings for all abilities even external of UltimateContent, and the other sub-section has global settings that are unique specifically to UltimateContent abilities.
# If an external plugin which adds more abilities is a fork of UltimateContent, these settings may be applicable to those abilities to, if not will just have no affect.
#
# UNIVERSAL SETTINGS:
#
#   "cooldown" : [DECIMAL] - This is the cooldown in seconds for the ability given to the user upon successful usage.
#
#   "usage" : [STRING_LIST] - The bound actions for usage of this ability, this is almost always required with a few abilities being an exception. Here is a list of all usages:
#
#                             "left-click", "left-click-block", "shift-left-click", "shift-left-click-block", "right-click", "right-click-block", "shift-right-click",

#                                 displays section of this config and can be referenced here in this setting. An example is how I create a fake display called "bunny_hop" and
#                                 reference it in the double jump ability for the bunny hop enchant, this relabels the abilities display name and description on the item's
#                                 lore to my display "bunny_hop"'s name and description.
#
# ULTIMATECONTENT UNIQUE SETTINGS:

#
#   "chance" : [DECIMAL] - This setting is the probability between 0.0-100.0 of this ability activating when it is used. Cooldown will not be applied on failed activations
#                          and by default this is set to 100.0 for all abilities to guarantee activation.
#

#

#                         the abilities cooldown upon activation this just modifies where the ability activates. This is a list of all the different target types you can use:
#
#                         "activator", "projectile", "hit-entity", "interacted-entity", "attacker", "shooter", "dropped-item", "block"

#
#   "name" : [STRING] - The display name of the enchant on items in game. The default color is vanilla gray but can be changed, chat color and hex codes are supported. There
#                       is also some place holders available in the name which are listed below:
#
#                                             %l% - Represents the level present as an integer
#                                             %nl% - Represents the level present as a roman numerical (Vanilla symbol)
#

#                          Within each levels section you can create an abilities section and create as many abilities as you want within this section, the different ability
#                          settings are listed at the top of this config in the ability settings section. Levels do not stack on each other meaning if an item with this
#                          enchant is upgraded from level 1 to level 2 it will lose the abilities from level 1 and gain the abilities from the level 2 section. There are

# ENTITIES:
#
# This section is for configuring the custom entities within UltimateContent.
#
#   "spawnRate" : [DECIMAL] - The chance of an entity spawning within its desired conditions. This number is from 0-100 and the entity conditions are unique for each category
#                             of entities which are explained above each category header. This defaults to 0 if not set.
#
#   "health" : [DECIMAL] - The health of the entity (1 minecraft heart = 2.0 health points).
#
#   "damage" : [DECIMAL] - The damage the entity deals with bare hand melee attacks. Keep in mind that some entities spawn with weapons in hand which can alter the damage.
#
#   "knockback" : [DECIMAL] - The knock back attribute of the entity type meaning that this is how far entities are knocked back by the entities melee attacks.
#
#   "movementSpeed" : [DECIMAL] - Sets the movement speed attribute of the entity. Lots of entities have hidden set default movement speeds and this setting can override them.
#
#   "name" : [STRING] - The name of the entity which is displayed above the entities head and also used for death messages in chat.
#
#   "nameVisible" : [BOOLEAN] - Sets the custom name visible tag of the entity to be visible or not. The vanilla behavior of name tags means that even if they are hidden the
#                               name tag is still visible when players are close to and directly looking at the entity. By default this is set to FALSE for all entity types.
#
#   "volume" : [DECIMAL] - The volume multiplier of the entity which controls the volume of the entities ambient sounds and ability sounds.
#
#   "equipment" : [SECTION] - The equipment override on the entity. This section is pretty self explanatory, you can set the equipment for the armor, main hand, and off hand
#                             on the entity type. Most entities have default equipment set, you can use this section to override the default equipment by setting the slot to
#                             "air" or another item. Below is an example of setting the equipment to remove the default helmet on the entity type and also set its hand items:
#
#                                                    equipment:
#                                                        head: "air"
#                                                        main_hand: "diamond_sword"
#                                                        off_hand: "uc:dark_mage_wand"
#
#   "drops" : [STRING_LIST] - This list is the drops table of the entity type. You can control what items are dropped, how much is dropped, the odds of the drop. If this is
#                             not set then the entity type will not drop anything upon death. You can also use items that are available via UltimateItemsFramework. You can
#                             also only partially set drops as a shortcut, for example if you just list the item then it will always drop 1 single item of that drop, if you
#                             do not set an amount to drop then it will only have a chance of dropping the item one time. Below this is an example and breakdown of a drop:
#
#                                                    drops:
#                                                    - "diamond" | 50.0 | 0-3
#
#                                                        "diamond" - The name of the item to drop, can also use custom items here (e.g. "uc:blood_ingot").
#                                                        50.0 - The second parameter is the chance of the drop from 0.0-100.0 so 50.0 means a 50% chance of dropping a diamond.
#                                                        0-3 - The third parameter is the amount of diamonds that are dropped. So this means that there is a 3 chances of
#                                                              dropping diamonds, each try will be the set chance of dropping a diamond so here that would be a 50% chance.
#                                                              You can also make this set to a minimum amount of drops (e.g. 2-6) meaning that the entity will always drop 2
#                                                              diamonds, but will have 4 more chances of dropping extra diamonds each at 50% so it can drop 6 diamonds as max.
#
#   "drop_rates" : [SECTION] - This section controls the drop rates for just the entities equipment. The reason why you wouldn't set the entities equipment as drops in the
#                              drops list is because sometimes variants of entities can spawn with different equipment so you would want to drop that specific equipment instead
#                              which is why there is a separate section for this. By default all entities equipment drop rates are set to 0 so this section can override that.
#                              The drop rates for equipment are handled as decimals between 0.0-100.0 and here is an example of a drop rate section on an entity:
#
#                                                    drop_rates:
#                                                        main_hand: 50.0      # 50% chance for the entity to drop the item in its main hand if applicable.
#                                                        off_hand: 15.0
#                                                        chest: 100.0
